# ballEngine

## What is ballEngine?

ballEngine is a simple 2D game engine developed as a personal project to learn C++. It uses the SFML graphics library which provides an implementation of the low-level OpenGL library. Development is in very early stages and more features are yet to come.

## Features

* 2D rigid body physics and collision detection for arbitrary convex polygons. Material properties include coefficient of friction and restitution which act realistically.

* Interactive n-body gravitational physics.

* Scratch developed Graphical User Interface.

* Sandbox mode: Can spawn anything and interact with the basic object editor.

* Fully customisable keybindings for functions which use the JSON format.

* Resource manager for textures and shaders

* Graphics engine which makes use of modifiable shaders


## Dependencies

* SFML 2.4.2
* nlohmann json.hpp
* InverseKinematicsLibrary


Note: Not included in this repository are the SFML libraries and Nlohmann's json.hpp.
