# ballEngine

## What is ballEngine?

ballEngine is a simple 2D game engine developed as a personal project to learn C++. It uses the SFML graphics library which provides an implementation of the low-level OpenGL library.

## Features

2D rigid body physics and collision detection for arbitrary convex polygons. Material properties include coefficient of friction and restitution which act realistically.

-Interactive n-body gravitational physics.

-Scratch developed Graphical User Interface.

-Sandbox mode: Can spawn anything and interact with the basic object editor.

-Fully customisable keybindings for functions which use the JSON format.





Note: Not included in this repository are the SFML libraries and Nlohmann's json.hpp.
