Graphics/Interface:

mouse click spawn location incorrect after window Resize

window resize does not scale well, fixed but needs an option to scale simulation size with window

Crash when attempting to delete balls while there are collisions going on


Physics:

very soon after a collision, and when another collision is close, the ball will simply pass through the ball it should collide with -
Kind of fixed, needs more testing

Physics is tied to framerate
